-When you see {urn:cite:hmt:vaimg.VA101RN-0102@0.6431,0.3624,0.015,0.0111} in the manuscript:
a) If it is located next to  a scholion and/or the main text it is a connecting mark. Be sure to keep a note of where this appears, but do not include any mark up.
b) If it appears within the text of a scholion to substitute for the word ἥλιος , treat this as an abbreviation. In the "abbr" element, use the unicode character ☉ (Edit->Special Characters->Miscellaneous Symbols->sun). In the “expan” element include the full word that the symbol stands for. Endings will be determined by context. It will look something like this:
(e.g.) <choice><abbr>☉</abbr><expan>ἡλιον</expan></choice>
