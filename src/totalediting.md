# An overview of the "total editing" process #

Editing proceeds by physical unit (for a codex, a single page) in this sequence:

1. [Paleographic sample](editing/palinv.html) of *Iliad* text: complete inventory of graphemes on first line of each folio
2. [Visual inventory](editing/visualInventory.html) of *Iliad* lines
4. [Hard-copy editing](editing/hardCopyEditing.html) of *Iliad* lines
4. [XML editing](editing/xmlediting.html) of *Iliad* lines
5. [Visual inventory](editing/visualInventory.html) of all scholia.  (Simultaneously check for and record any non-textual features appearing on your page.)
6. [Paleographic sample](editing/palinv.html) of scholia:  first 20 graphemes inventoried
7. Complete [XML editing](editing/xmlediting.html) of scholia
