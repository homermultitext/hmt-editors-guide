# How to Submit Issues to the Authority Lists #

## New Personal Name ##
When editing you may come across a new personal name that is not currently in the list. Be sure to check the list thoroughly, testing alternate spellings or names. If you cannot find this name, you should submit a new issue to the issue tracker in the hmt-authlist repository. Here is what you must include:

	- Title the Issue: New Personal Name
	- The name of the new person
	- A description of the person, including any other names the person may go by and distinct identifying characteristics. E.g. Paris, son of Priam, also called Alexander
	- The full TextUrn of where the name appears (i.e. Iliad or scholia)

The new name will be checked and if it is determined to be a valid new personal name, one of our editors will close the issue and you can then tag the name appropriately in your text.

## New Place Name ##
When editing you may come across a new place name that is not currently in the list. Be sure to check the list thoroughly, testing alternate spellings or names. If you cannot find this place, you should submit a new issue to the issue tracker in the hmt-authlist repository. Here is what you must include:

	- Title the Issue: New Place Name
	- The name of the new place
	- A description of the place, including geographic region and any other names the place may go by (e.g. Troy, a city in the Troad, also called Ilium)
	- The full TextUrn of where the name appears (i.e. Iliad or scholia)
	- [Pleiades reference](http://pleiades.stoa.org/), located under the heading “Cannonical URI” (if it exists) 

The new place will be checked and if it is determined to be a valid new place name, one of our editors will close the issue and you can then tag the name appropriately in your text.

## Conflict in the List ##
If during your use of the authority list you come across a conflict in the list, such as a reduplication or a misattribution, also create an issue in the hmt-authlist issue tracker. Here is what you must include:

	- Title the Issue: Conflict in Personal/Place Name List
	- Record the URNs of any entries that are questionable
	- A short description of what you think is wrong

## Expanding an Entry ##
You may find during your work that an entry in the list needs to be expanded, for instance if you find another name for a place or personal that already exists but is not recorded in the list. When this happens you should create an issue in the hmt-authlist issue tracker. Here is what you must include:

	- Title the Issue: Recommended Expansion
	- Indicate which list and what entry by URN
	- Indicate the TextUrn where you found reason to expand the entry
	- A short description of what you think should be added to the description
