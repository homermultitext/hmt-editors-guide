## Orthography ##

**accentuation and breathings**
:	We record all accents and breathings as given in the manuscript (not "corrected" to modern usage).  This category includes diaeresis, and markings for short or long vowel quantities (breve and macron).

**iota**
: Iotas are consistently written adscript in most of our manuscripts: we write them subscript where that is usual in modern practice without implying that the manuscript does so.

**ligatures and variant letter forms**
: Our transcription does not  note ligatures or variant letter forms: readers interested in these visual features of the manuscript should consult the associated high-resolution images.  We treat regular abbreviations for morphological endings, for prepositions, and for the conjunction καί as variant letter forms, and silently expand these in the transcriptions.
