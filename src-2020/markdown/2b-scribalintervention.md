## 4: More extensive scribal intervention in the text


### Scribal Deletions

Use TEI `del` when the scribe has either crossed out content, erased, or marked it with "deletion dots"

Example:

`<del>οὐκ εἰς το πρεσβεύειν ἀλλ εἰς τὸ πρεσβεύειν Αἴαντας καὶ Ὀδυσσέα Φοίνικος προέληλυθότος</del>` (urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msA.hmt:9.193)

### Scribal Corrections

Use TEI `sic/corr` pair for corrections when the wants to correct a reading that is unintelligible in the text;  group the pair in a TEI `choice` element.

Example: accent corrected by the original scribe

`<choice><sic>προσηῦδα</sic><corr>προσηύδα</corr></choice>`

(urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.msA:4.337)

[corr]: http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/VenA/VA058RN-0059.tif&RGN=0.5245,0.275,0.0871,0.0308&WID=100&CVT=JPEG

Please note that this mark up is *only* used by corrections we believe were made by the scribe. That means you cannot offer your own corrections and the scribe could be wrong by our orthographic standards. This is a diplomatic editions and we do not want to make our own judges on grammatical correctness at this stage of editing.


### Scribal Multiforms

Use the TEI `orig/reg` pair to identify the reading in the main text and the alternative reading; group them with TEI `choice`.  The  scribe sometimes writes only the letters that are to be changed to create the alternate reading.  We put the fully expanded word in the `reg` element.

Example:

`<choice><orig>μεθειέμεν</orig><reg>μεθιέμεν</reg></choice>`

(urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.msA:4.351)


[![alternative text][alt]][104]

Alternative readings are typically strings of characters or even single letters. You will use the whole word like in the example above.
