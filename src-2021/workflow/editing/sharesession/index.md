2. At the top of VS Code window, the command palette will prompt you to authenticate.  Choose `Sign in using GitHub account`  ![](../../../imgs/ghsignin.png)
3. VS Code will open a web page where you can authenticate with your Github user name and password.  Choose `Continue` when you see a screen like this.  ![](../../../imgs/authorize.png)
