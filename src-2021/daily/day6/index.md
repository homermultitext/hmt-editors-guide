# Day 6: Scholia reading party

We will spend the entire session in the main room joinly reading *scholia*.



## Goals

Collaborate in applying all possible clues to help us understand *scholia* we are editing.



## What each team will do

Each team will introduce in no more than 3 minutes the *scholion* that they prepared on Friday.  We will work as a group to read it.
