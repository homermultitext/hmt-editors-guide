# Day 5: presenting a scholion


## Goals

Prepare a slide show or notes to present one *scholion* to the whole group for joint reading and discussion

## What each team will do

Choose one *scholion* your team has looked at.  Prepare a markdown slide presentation or page of notes  including:

- the *Iliad* passage your scholion comments on, and a brief summary of the context in the *Iliad*
- the page of the MS your scholion is on.  
- a reference to an illustration that you can put in the chat stream
- your transcription
- any questions, problems, highlights
