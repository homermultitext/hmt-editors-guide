# Homer Multitext project: summer experience 2021

Dates: June 28 - July 9, inclusive

Times: M-F, 12:00-1:00 eastern time

## Overview

This year's summer experience will introduce participants to the full process of editing a manuscript of the *Iliad* with *scholia* for the Homer Multitext project.

We will be working on *Iliad* 4 in an important 11th-century manuscript, the "Venetus B"(Venice, Marciana 453 = 821).

You can find assignments of individual pages for each team on the [teams](./teams/) page.



## Preparation

1. Please treat yourself by (re)reading *Iliad* 4 in your favorite translate.  Or be really nice to yourself, and read the first four books of the *Iliad* in your favorite translation.
2. Please follow the instructions on  [this page](./tech/) to install the software we will be using. Everyone need to use Visual Studio Code with the Live Share extension on day 1.  To take on the role of hosting a session later in the program, you'll need to have Julia installed with Pluto notebooks.
