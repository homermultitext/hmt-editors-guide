# More extensions for editing with VS Code


## Slide shows

In our meetings this summer, you'll see slide shows running in VS Code.  If you want to write markdown content and run a slide show from it, explore the `vscode-reveal` extension or the `marp-vscode` extension.


## Using Julia in VS Code

You can run the same code we use in our validating notebooks in VS Code with the `julia` extension.

## Others

If you use an extension that makes your work on the HMT project easier, share your tips with other participants!
