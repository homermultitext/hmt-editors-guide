# Account on github

## What it does

We use github to share our editing work.  When we edit shared documents with Visual Studio Code, we also use our github accounts to authenticate our permissions in shared editing sessions.


## Create a github account

- create a free account on [https://github.com](https://github.com)



## Testing your account

Verify that you know your user name and password by restarting your browser, and logging in to github.


> ## ❗️ Nota bene
> The first time you take part in a collaborative editing session using VS Code with the [Live Share extension](../github/liveshare/), you will need to know your github name, and password
>
> If you already have a github account, but have forgotten your password, reset your password before our first group meeting.
>
> You will also need to know the email you used to register with github when you [configure git for your personal machine](../git/)
