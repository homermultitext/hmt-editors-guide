# Workflow


## Overview

1. In VS Code, session hosts [clone their team's repository](./cloning/).  Note where you save it.
2. The host starts a Pluto notebook server, and [opens your repository's validating notebook](./pluto/).
3. The whole team [edits](./editing/) (a very little bit).
4. The host [validates](./validating/).  The team fixes their edits as necessary.
5. In VS Code, the host [stages (adds), commits and pushes the team's changes changes](./committing/).
6. Repeat 3-5 as often as you like.
7. The host quits VS code and [deletes the clone of the repository](./cleanup/) you made in step 1.
