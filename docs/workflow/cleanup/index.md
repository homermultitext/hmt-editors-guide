# Cleaning up

At the end of an editing session, the session host should remove all working files.  We want to ensure that we start every editing session with a fresh, up-to-date clone of your team's repository.


1. Verify that you have only one modified file not committed to github, and verify that that file is your validating notebook. (See notes on [committing your work](../committing/) if that's not clear.)
2. Quit VS Code. This will guaran
3. Find the clone of your repository on your computer. If you can't remember where you saved it, your validating notebook can help you:  it has a heading that looks like this example, telling you where you cloned the repository. ![](../../../imgs/nbheader.png)
4. Trahs the clone of your repository.
