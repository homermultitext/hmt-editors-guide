title: "HMT editor's guide"

The current published version of the HMT project guide to editorial policy reflects the definition of editorial policies at the beginning of our 2014 summer seminar.    Ongoing work in preparation for the next published version is publicly visible in the master branch of the [github repository](https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-editors-guide) for the guide, and is written in markdown.


## Summer, 2014 edition ##

An HTML version of the summer, 2014, edition of the guide that you can read in a web browser is available  [here](editorial-policies).
