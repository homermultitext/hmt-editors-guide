# Homer Multitext project: editor's guide



## Overview

This is an in-progress draft in summer, 2023, of the HMT project's guide for editors.  It is derived from the website we used for our [on-line summer experience in 2021](https://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-se2021/).

> Help us improve it by submitting corrections and suggestions on the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-editors-guide/issues).

## Preparation

Please follow the instructions on  [this page](./tech/) to install the software we use.
