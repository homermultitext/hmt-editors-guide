# Key to understanding the typography in Erbse, *Scholia Vetera in* Iliadem

- parenthesized references are to the *Iliad* passage being commented on.
- number highlighted <span class="hl">like this</span> (possibly followed by letters and more numbers, e.g., "<span class="hl">2</span> b 2") gives Erbse's identifier for that scholion
- italicized abbreviations in margins, separated by vertical bar (pipe), give Erbse's attributions. Corresponding vertical bars in the text break up the text into the sections he attributes to each source. (NB: we can ignore all of this.)
- highlighted sigla following a passage of text indicate which MS or group of MSS the content occurs in (or should occur in, in Erbse's judgment), e.g., *ἐν δὲ τῇ κατὰ Ἀριστοφάνη εἰ δ' αὕτως διὰ τοῦ τ.* <span class="hl">A</span>
- initial text set off by a  colon: lemma for entry
- angle brackets: Erbse's restorations, not in MS
- within the text, parenthesized notes gives references to sources of quoted passages.  *Iliad* passages are cited as books *Α-Ω* and *Odyssey* passages as books *α-ω*.
