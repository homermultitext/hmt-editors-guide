# Installing and configuring  VS Code


## Install Visual Studio Code

- [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install Visual Studio Code for your operating system


## Installing extensions

Visual Studio Code has a plethora of extensions you can add for specific kinds of editing. To add an extension, first select from the column of icons on the far left of your VS Code window the “Extensions” icon that looks like four puzzle pieces (illustrated here). Then search for the name of the extension you want to add. (Here we have searched for “Scholarly XML”.)

We will use three extensions in our editing:

1. Live Share
2. Scholarly XML
3. Rainbow CSV

Follow the links below for details on installing and configuring each extension.
