# Day 4: editing scholia


## Goals

Understand the relation of scholion text, scholion marker, and *Iliad* passage

## What each team will do

Edit the first *scholion* on your assigned page, including:

- indexing to image and page (just like *Iliad* lines)
- recording *Iliad* reference, *lemma* and commentary in XML edition
- indexing the scholion marker
