# Characters and character sequences #

## Diacritical Marks ##

Most Greek keyboards are not able to handle more than two diacritical marks, so in instances where you need and accent, breathing, and a diacritical mark, use combining characters which are typically found in special character menus in most basic text editors.

**diaereses** on vowels with breathing and/or accent should use Unicode "Combining Diaeresis" character.
