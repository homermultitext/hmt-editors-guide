# Homer Multitext project: Editors' Guide #

HMT has divided its editorial policies into four main tiers.

1. transcription
2. tokenization
3. editorial disambiguation
4. discourse disambiguation

Some of these policies are reflected in our editorial choices of what to transcribe in our xml editions and others require specific TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) mark up.
